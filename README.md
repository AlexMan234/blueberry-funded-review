## Blueberry Funded review

If you‚Äôre a trader looking to get funded, you‚Äôve probably seen Blueberry Funded pop up on your radar. That‚Äôs exactly what happened to me.

The idea of trading with someone else‚Äôs capital sounds like a dream to most people who have traded with their own money and faced the fear of losses. For years, retail traders have been looking for ways to reduce risk while still participating in the markets. That‚Äôs where prop firms like Blueberry Funded come in.

I‚Äôve tried other prop firms in the past, including both the big names and smaller ones. Some delivered great experiences. Others left me frustrated. But I always want to give new firms a fair shot, especially when they offer a clean, one-step process with decent rules.

In this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what Blueberry Funded offers, how it works, what I experienced using it, and why I think it‚Äôs worth your attention (or not).One negative aspect of Blueberry Funded is that they don‚Äôt offer a free retry if you fail the challenge, even when you followed all the rules and ended in profit. This can be really frustrating ‚Äî especially for traders who were cautious, took minimal risks, and still fell slightly short of the profit target.

Let‚Äôs say you spent two or three weeks trading responsibly, avoided all drawdown violations, and finished the challenge with a 6.5% gain instead of the required 8%. Even though you showed consistency and solid risk management, you‚Äôd still have to pay the full evaluation fee again just to try a second time.

Many competing prop firms offer a ‚Äúfree retry‚Äù in cases like that. It‚Äôs their way of encouraging good behavior and giving traders a second shot without punishing them financially for being careful. Blueberry‚Äôs lack of that option makes it feel a bit less forgiving ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre on a budget or trying to build your career with limited capital.

This policy can discourage newer traders who might be doing everything right, just not fast enough, and it places extra pressure on performing perfectly the first time.

## What Is Blueberry Funded?

Blueberry Funded is a proprietary trading firm that provides funding to forex, crypto, and CFD traders after they pass an evaluation phase. Once you prove that you can trade profitably and manage risk, they‚Äôll give you a funded account to trade on their behalf.

You keep a majority of the profits while the firm takes a small percentage. In return, you don‚Äôt have to risk your own capital.

Unlike traditional investing or using your own brokerage account, prop firms like this let you trade larger amounts without worrying about blowing your savings.

## Evaluation Model and Challenge Rules

![Evaluation Flow](https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KzlS7c1miGMuacDN-Xd3tgHaD4&pid=Api)

To qualify for a funded account, you first have to complete their one-phase challenge. Here's what that typically involves:

- **Profit Target**: Reach 8% profit on the account without violating rules.
- **Drawdown Limits**: Max daily drawdown around 5%, total drawdown 10%.
- **Minimum Trading Days**: Usually 5, to prove consistency.
- **Platform**: MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5.
- **Assets**: Trade forex pairs, indices, crypto, and commodities.

These rules prevent people from gambling their way through. You can‚Äôt just throw on a big trade, hit 8%, and cash out. You‚Äôve got to show control and discipline.

Many traders fail challenges not because their strategy is bad ‚Äî but because they don‚Äôt follow risk management. That‚Äôs key with Blueberry Funded too.

## User Interface and Setup

Their web portal is straightforward. I received my account login credentials within 2 hours of purchasing the challenge. The dashboard had my metrics: current profit/loss, drawdown level, days traded, and whether I was in violation.

Everything was clean, and I liked how transparent it all felt. There weren‚Äôt any mysterious metrics or confusing performance targets. It was laid out clearly.

## What Happens After You Pass?

Once I passed the challenge, I received an email with a trader agreement. I signed it digitally, and within 48 hours I was issued a live funded account.

Here‚Äôs what happens once you‚Äôre live:

- You trade a real account with actual capital behind it.
- You start earning **real payouts** based on profit splits (80/20).
- You can request withdrawals once you meet payout criteria.
- Continued success can lead to **account scaling** ‚Äî more funding.

It‚Äôs important to note: you‚Äôre still responsible for risk. If you blow the account by violating drawdown rules, it ends your funded status. So passing is only step one ‚Äî keeping it is just as important.

## Pricing Structure

The challenge fee is a one-time payment, and it depends on account size:

- **$25K** ‚Äì $139
- **$50K** ‚Äì $249
- **$100K** ‚Äì $399

There are no recurring subscription fees. If you fail the challenge, you‚Äôll have to repurchase it to try again. There wasn‚Äôt an option for a free retry when I did mine, which would‚Äôve been nice ‚Äî some firms offer that.

Still, compared to losing your own capital, paying for a challenge is pretty affordable if you‚Äôre confident in your system.

## My Personal Experience with Blueberry Funded

![Live Account Stats](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.OE8m6S9xFVzJa_LCEOyh0QHaCe&pid=Api)

### Getting Started

I opted for the $50K evaluation. Setup was fast. I logged into MT4, ran my usual indicators, and began trading.

I used a conservative scalping strategy on GBP/JPY and EUR/USD ‚Äî not going for home runs, just building slow gains.

### The Challenge Phase

Over the first week, I gained around 4%. Took a small step back after a losing day. Recovered and gradually pushed to 8.3% over 12 trading days.

I submitted for review and passed. Got the agreement by email, and was upgraded shortly after.

### The Funded Phase

Now the real fun began. It felt different trading with the real funded account. I was cautious, but still stuck to my process.

I made just over $1,000 within 2 weeks and requested a payout. I chose crypto. The funds landed in my wallet in 48 hours ‚Äî no delays, no excuses.

## Support and Communication

I contacted their support team 3 times:

1. To ask about minimum days required (they replied in 30 mins).
2. To clarify the withdrawal method.
3. To check payout timeline.

Each time, they were fast and clear. I never felt like I was being brushed off or stuck waiting days for a reply. That‚Äôs rare with newer firms.

## Features I Liked

- **Fast challenge results**: I was reviewed within a day of submitting.
- **Transparent rules**: No weird ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù policies.
- **Easy dashboard**: Visuals made it easy to track my progress.
- **80% profit split**: One of the better ratios for traders.
- **Crypto payout option**: Instant and private.

## Features I Didn't Like

- **No free retry**: If you finish in profit but don‚Äôt hit 8%, you still have to pay again.
- **Only MT4/MT5**: Would‚Äôve liked support for cTrader or TradingView terminals.
- **Still gaining recognition**: Not as established as FTMO or the big names.

Blueberry holds its own. If you want something fast, straightforward, and no-nonsense, it‚Äôs a good option.

## Is Blueberry Funded Legit?

Yes, based on my experience. I got funded. I got paid. The rules were clear. No shady tactics. That puts them in the top tier, in my book.

## Final Verdict

It‚Äôs not perfect. But it works. And more importantly ‚Äî it pays.
